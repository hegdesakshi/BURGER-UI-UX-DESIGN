# BURGER-UI-UX-DESIGN

Created a Burger UI Design in Figma, focusing on a clean and engaging interface for a food-ordering app. The project includes a single user interface page enhanced with smooth animations to make interactions visually appealing. It’s not a complete app, but a UI exploration concept.
